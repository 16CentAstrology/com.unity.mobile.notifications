#### Why are small Android icons white in the editor notification settings preview

Small notification icons are [required](https://material.io/design/platform-guidance/android-notifications.html#anatomy-of-a-notification) to be monochrome and Android ignores all non-alpha channels in the icon image, therefore Unity automatically strips all RGB channels.

You can also provide icons by putting them in the `\Assets\Plugins\Android\res\drawable-{scaleFactor}`folder which will not be automatically processed, however icons which contain non alpha channel will not be correctly displayed on Android 5.0 and above.

The notification color can be modified by [AndroidNotification.Color](../api/Unity.Notifications.Android.AndroidNotification.html#Unity_Notifications_Android_AndroidNotification_Color) property.

#### Why are Notifications not delivered on certain Huawei and Xiaomi phones when my app is closed and not running in the background

Seems that Huawei (including Honor) and Xiaomi utilize [aggresive batter saver techniques](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47145722/how-to-deal-with-huaweis-and-xiaomis-battery-optimizations) which restricts app background activities, unless the app has been whitelisted by the user in device settings. 
This means that any scheduled notifications will not be delivered if the app is closed or not running in the background. We are not aware of any way to workaround this besides encouraging the user to whitelist your app.

#### What can I do if notifications with a location trigger donâ€™t work

Make sure the `CoreLocation framework` has been added to your Project, you can check [notification settings](settings.html#include-corelocation-framework) to see how to do this in the package.
Alternatively, you can add it manually to the Xcode project, or use the Unity Xcode API. You also need to use the [Location Service API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LocationService.html) to request permission for your app to access location data.
